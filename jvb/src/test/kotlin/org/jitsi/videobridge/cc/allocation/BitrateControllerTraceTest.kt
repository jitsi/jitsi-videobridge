/**
 * This test reads a trace file containing bandwidth estimations and bitrates for individual layers captured from a
 * "real" conference. The conference had a total of 7 endpoints (one receiver and 6 senders), and the bridge->receiver
 * BWE was artificially reset to 0 just prior to taking the trace, simulating a ramp-up from 0.
 *
 * While [BitrateControllerTest] tests the individual decisions made by [BandwidthAllocator] when the bitrates of the
 * layers are fixed, here we test for the number of allocation changes which are visible to the user as changes in the
 * number and/or quality of the videos being shown. Specifically, we want to limit the "flickering" which happens as
 * a result of fluctuations in the bitrates of the layers and the changes in BWE.
