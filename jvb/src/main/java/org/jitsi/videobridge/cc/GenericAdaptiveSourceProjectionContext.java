/**
 * A generic implementation of an adaptive source projection context that can be
 * used with non-SVC codecs or when simulcast is not enabled/used or when
 * support for these advanced features is not implemented in the bridge. In this
 * restricted case the source projection can have only two states (or qualities),
 * either off or on (or -1, 0).
 *
 * Instances of this class suspend a source when the target quality is set to -1.
 * When the target quality is set back to 0, the request key frame flag is
 * raised and the source is re-activated after a key frame is received.
 * (consequently support for key frame detection for the specific media format
 * of the source that is being adapted is necessary).
 *
 * In order to make the suspend/resume operation transparent to the receiver (at
 * least in the RTP level), instances of this class rewrite the RTP sequence
 * numbers of the source to hide the gaps caused by the suspend/resume
 * operation.
 *
 * This may not be sufficient for fluid playback at the receiver as the decoder
 * may be unable to handle codec specific discontinuities (such as discontinuous
 * picture IDs in VP8). In this case a codec specific adaptive source projection
 * context implementation will have to be used instead.
 *
 * Instances of this class are thread-safe.
