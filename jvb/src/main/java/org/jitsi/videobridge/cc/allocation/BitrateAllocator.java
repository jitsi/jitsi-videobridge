/**
 * The {@link BitrateAllocator} is attached to a destination {@code
 * Endpoint} and its purpose is 1st to selectively drop incoming packets
 * based on their source {@link Endpoint} and 2nd to rewrite the accepted
 * packets so that they form a correct RTP stream without gaps in their
 * sequence numbers nor in their timestamps.
 * <p>
 * In the Selective Forwarding Middlebox (SFM) topology [RFC7667], senders are
 * sending multiple bitstreams of (they multistream) the same video source
 * (using either with simulcast or scalable video coding) and the SFM decides
 * which bitstream to send to which receiver.
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose we're in a 3-way simulcast-enabled video call (so 3
 * source {@link Endpoint}s) where the endpoints are sending two
 * non-scalable RTP streams of the same video source. The bitrate controller,
 * will chose to forward only one RTP stream at a time to a specific destination
 * endpoint.
 * <p>
 * With scalable video coding (SVC) a bitstream can be broken down into multiple
 * sub-bitstreams of lower frame rate (that we call temporal layers or TL)
 * and/or lower resolution (that we call spatial layers or SL). The exact
 * dependencies between the different layers of an SVC bitstream are codec
 * specific but, as a general rule of thumb higher temporal/spatial layers
 * depend on lower temporal/spatial layers creating a dependency graph.
 * <p>
 * For example, a 720p@30fps VP8 scalable bitstream can be broken down into 3
 * sub-bitstreams: one 720p@30fps layer (the highest temporal layer), that
 * depends on a 720p@15fps layer that depends on a 720p7.5fps layer (the lowest
 * temporal layer). In order for the decoder to be able decode the highest
 * temporal layer, it needs to get all the packets of its direct and transitive
 * dependencies, so of both the other two layers. In this simple case we have a
 * linked list of dependencies with the the lowest temporal layer as root and
 * the highest temporal layer as a leaf.
 * <p>
 * In order for the SFM to be able to filter the incoming packets we need to be
 * able to assign incoming packets to "flows" with properties that allow us to
 * define filtering rules. In this implementation a flow is represented by an
 * {@link RtpLayerDesc} and its properties are bitrate and subjective quality
 * index. Specifically, the incoming packets belong to some {@link FrameDesc},
 * which belongs to some {@link RtpLayerDesc}, which belongs to some {@link
 * MediaSourceDesc}, which belongs to the source {@link Endpoint}.
 * This hierarchy allows for fine-grained filtering up to the {@link FrameDesc}
 * level.
 * <p>
 * The decision of whether to project or drop a specific RTP packet of a
 * specific {@link FrameDesc} of a specific {@link MediaSourceDesc}
 * depends on the bitrate allocation of the specific {@link
 * MediaSourceDesc} and on the state of the bitstream that is produced by
 * this filter. For example, if we have a {@link MediaSourceDesc} with 2
 * {@link RtpLayerDesc} in a simulcast configuration, then we can switch
 * between the two {@link RtpLayerDesc}s if it is mandated by the bitrate
 * allocation and only if we see a refresh point.
