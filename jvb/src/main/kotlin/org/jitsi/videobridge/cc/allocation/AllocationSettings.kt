     * in high resolution. We also set the "preferred" resolution and the "preferred" frame rate. Under the hood this
     * instructs the bandwidth allocator to and eagerly allocate bandwidth up to the preferred resolution and
     * preferred frame-rate.
     *
     * The max height constraint was added for tile-view back when everything was expressed as "selected" endpoints, the
     * idea being we mark everything as selected (so endpoints aren't limited to 180p) and set the max to 360p (so
     * endpoints are limited to 360p, instead of 720p which is normally used for selected endpoints. This was the quickest,
     * not the nicest way to implement the tile-view constraints signaling and it was subsequently used to implement
     * low-bandwidth mode.
     *
     * One negative side effect of this solution, other than being a hack, was that the eager bandwidth allocation that we
     * do for selected endpoints doesn't work well in tile-view because we end-up with a lot of ninjas.
     *
     * By simply setting an ideal height X as a global constraint, without setting a preferred resolution/frame-rate, we
     * signal to the bandwidth allocator that it needs to (evenly) distribute bandwidth across all participants, up to X.
