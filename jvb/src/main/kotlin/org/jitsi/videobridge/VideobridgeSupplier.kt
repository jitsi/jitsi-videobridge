/**
 * Rather than creating [Videobridge] as part of an OSGi service,
 * centralize its creation here.  This is a temporary solution until
 * all other services are moved off of OSGi; once that is done then
 * [Videobridge] can be created normally (in main, most likely) and
 * passed to the other entities when they are created.
 *
 * NOTE: This is intentionally implemented as a non-static instance
 * for testability.  Classes should take in an instance of [VideobridgeSupplier]
 * which can be swapped for testing.  Production code should use
 * [videobridgeSupplier] as the instance it passes everywhere.
 *
 * Note: this class needs to be open for testing (java/mockito can't mock
 * a final class).  If we move tests to kotlin/mockk, we can remove it.
