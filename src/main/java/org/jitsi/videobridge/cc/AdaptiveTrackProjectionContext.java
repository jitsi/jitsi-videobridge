 * Implementations of this interface are responsible for projecting a specific
 * video track of a specific payload type.
 *
 * One can imagine signaling a specific encoding layout (i.e. 3 temporal layers)
 * and multiple codec support (e.g. VP8 SVC and VP9 SVC). In the bridge such
 * signaling would translate into an AdaptiveTrackProjection instance that would
 * remain active throughout the life of the source video track and would receive
 * updates from the bitrate controller (i.e. ideal index and target index). The
 * specific way of projecting VP9 SVC or VP8 SVC is implemented in "context"
 * classes that know how to deal with codec specificities.
